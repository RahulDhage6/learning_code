# learning_code

So basically, this entire repository is something to milestone my personal journey in learning to code, specifically in C and C++ leaning towards the quantitative developer field, and in COBOL just for the sake of learning. I'm a 2nd year Computer Engineering student at Manipal Institute of Technology, India with an interest in financials & working of the economy, and would love to work in the same field. Another dear diary stuff on GitHub, eh. Hopefully it's going to be of use for someone in the future.
